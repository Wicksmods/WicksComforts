-- Wick's Comforts
-- Fixes.lua: quiet a couple of the beta client's own errors.
--
-- These are not preferences and they are not our bugs. They are places
-- where Blizzard's own code on this build reaches for something that was
-- never created, throws, and spams the error frame every reload. Each fix
-- here is conditional: it only acts when the fault is actually present,
-- so it does nothing on a client where the code is correct and it retires
-- itself the moment Blizzard patches it.
--
-- This is the one part of the addon that starts switched on, because an
-- error you did not cause and cannot act on is not a preference.

-- Blizzard_GroupFinder_VanillaStyle shares one tab handler between its
-- Classic and Mainline variants, and on this build the tab handler can
-- reach LFGWhoListFrame before anything has created it, which throws.
-- Standing a plain hidden frame under that name is enough to quiet it:
-- their code only calls SetShown and IsShown on it.
--
-- The timing is the whole fix, and getting it wrong is worse than not
-- having it. The group finder is load on demand. An earlier version
-- checked only that the addon *existed*, which is true at login, and so
-- claimed the global name before Blizzard's own code had ever run. When
-- the player opened /who the real frame could not be created, and the
-- panel came up with its close button and side tabs drawn and nothing
-- in the middle.
--
-- So: never before their addon has loaded. Once it has loaded and still
-- has no frame of that name, the fault is real and the stub is safe.
